# Results Template
A template for a data analysis folder that can be easily exported as a webpage or as Supplementary Materials


- How to use it?

Fork it or download it as "zip" and edit.

- How to upload it to a website?

Upload the whole folder to GitHub, go to settings and enable GitHub pages, and select the `docs/` folder as the location of the webpage. Indeed, rendering (knitting) the files will generate an "index.html" file in the `/docs/` folder, which is used as the website.
